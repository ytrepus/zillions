This is the range of integers that can be named in the short scale using
words found in dictionaries*.  There are quite a few ad-hoc systems for 
naming numbers larger than this, but the lack of consistency and 
consensus, even among the more 'authoritative' options, is a bit 
unsatisfying, so I plan to stick with the core dictionary words.

*Particularly, unabridged American dictionaries.  UK English dictionaries
like the Oxford English Dictionary not to have number words after
'decillion', which in the long scale allow you to name the exact same 
range.  Britain traditionally used the long scale, like much of the rest
of the world, but now uses the short scale in line with the USA.
